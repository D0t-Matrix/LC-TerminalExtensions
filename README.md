# LC-TerminalExtensions
A repo to track terminal mods being worked on by [D0t-Matrix](https://github.com/D0t-Matrix/LC-TerminalExtensions/).

### MatrixTermExtensions
A variant of [ANormalTwig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/anormaltwig/)'s [TerminalExtras](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/anormaltwig/TerminalExtras/) mod, replacing the door toggle with explicit open/close commands.

Made primarily for my friend group, and for personal coding practice.

## Commands
* Open Door
  * Opens the door, if not already open
  * alt: "open"
* Close Door
  * Closes the door, if not already closed
  * alt: "close"
* Teleport
  * Activates the Teleporter
  * alt: "tp"
* InverseTeleport
  * Activates the Inverse Teleporter
  * alt: "itp"
* Lightsout

* Lightson
